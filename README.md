The idea I have is to use Botpress opensource chatbot frame work to build a "Teacher" that will guide a student through their preffered curriculum. They will have a list of materials they can cover as well as youtube videos and other content. The teacher will be able to field questions the student may have and guide them to external resources that will help their learning.
